# Cube

The Cube is a project I made to explore the possibilities of the modern web using Three.js, where a user scans a QR code using their phone, allowing them to control a 3D cube on another screen.

The controller UI is written in vanilla JS. The server acts as a relay between the controller and the game board, and uses channels to isolate game instances.
